# Summary

I set out to recreate the Hero Quest game board with OpenLOCK tiles. The walls on the game board are pretty thin. I remixed the floors and the low walls from the updated [OpenLOCK Dungeon](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2787904) series to make these "S" style walls.

The doors are resized from the [TrueTiles Sample Set](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1598221), so they could clip onto the dungeon walls.

# How I Designed This

I used TinkerCad to merge the dungeon floor pieces with the wall pieces. I would have used the full height walls, but the files are too detailed, the low walls worked great.

## Map Layout

Here's the drawing I made to figure out the layout. The rooms on the left side of the map had to be widened by 1 square to make room for the walls.

Floors:
2x1 = 4
3x3 = 9
4x4 = 12
3x1 = 17
2x2 = 13
4x1 = 44

Walls:
1x1 L = 25
1x1 T = 28
1x1 X = 3
4x1 = 31
3x1 = 34
2x1 = 16
1x1 = 1
