# Instructions

## Supplies

* Wall printed parts and torch printed part
* [Pin Vice](https://www.amazon.com/tool-home-Precision-Model-Drill-Twist/dp/B010BV7190/ref=pd_lpo_328_bs_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=9DPBGCPD053ZXK73EAE4) (optional)
* Aluminum foil strip, 3 inches wide
* Hobby knife and or wire cutters to clip the aluminum foil to length
* Hot glue gun and hot glue

I recommend getting walmart tea light votive candles.  This is a case where walmart's drive to drop the price as far as they can plays really well for us.  They use fewer parts then anyone else, so this means that it's literally just a few plastic pieces, a flickering yellow led and a battery.  When you take it apart, you get an led that isn't soldered to anything, and it's leads aren't clipped, making the torch process easier.  Read about this below the instructions.

**Important Note:** At every step you can, test with a battery base to make sure all the connections are still working fine.  You are going to be super unhappy if you glue the back on and then it stops working because you didn't test.

Clear out the holes in the torch with the pin vice, or look at the [powered clip]() for instructions on how you can bodge a workable plastic drill with the copper wire.

Run the LED leads through the torch.  Test it against a powered base, WITH THE TORCH FACING LIKE IT WILL ON THE WALL to make sure the leads are in properly.  LEDs can only be wired one way, so be very careful that you are not positioning these backwards.

If you flip the battery base upside down but leave the torch right side up, that will be the correct circuit.  Push the leads against the aluminum in the battery base hole to test that it lights.

Paint the torch however you want to.  I use an umber brown, and a dry brush of a lighter brown, with bronze for the rings.

Finally, use the hot glue gun to put some hot glue on the LED itself.  Use a toothpick (or something similar) to try and shape a flame.

Paint wall part 1 and 2 before wiring.  Put a dab of hot glue on the back of the torch, then push the leads through the holes in wall part 1.

Put the aluminum up through the interior holes.  Fold down the leads, and place them inside the folds of the aluminum.  If you have the right skills and equipment, you can solder the leads to the foil.

Hot glue the interior to insulate the contacts and to hold everything into place.  Slap the back on while the hot glue is still sticky.  I use hot glue here because it's easier to open up in the future if you need to then superglue.

The LED's leads just run through the plastic
